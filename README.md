# How to deploy it

The site deploys automatically to GitHub Pages when you push to `main` (see [.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)). To deploy manually from your machine:

```
pnpm run deploy
```

**If the live site is blank:** In the repo go to **Settings → Pages**. Set **Source** to **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch"). Save, then open **Actions** → "Deploy to GitHub Pages" → **Run workflow**. The site will be at `https://alxdolphin.github.io/k-will-you-be-my-valentine/`.
